Alliances concern themselves with communication, logistics/transport systems, mediation between alliance members, collective security, quarantine and environmental management</li>	<li>There is no formal global legal system or administrative structure</li>	<li>Shift of service delivery from public sector agencies to the private sector and not-for-profit groups</li>	<li>Assertion of local, individual and community concerns in parallel with the globalisation and depersonalisation of communication systems (including mass media).  That is as communication provides global information and projects global trends, communities balance this at a human level with strong personal local ties</li>	<li>Growth in creativity as a tradable commodity - thereby freeing up communities from traditional services and products as a means of generating income</li></ul>{% include includes/2121foot.html %}
