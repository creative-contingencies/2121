There will be a borderless world in which there are many diverse cultures, and concurrently many common cultural influences with a shared value system leading to stronger identification of our shared humanity, our mutual obligations, and a commitment  to strengthening our local and global environment and communities.</p><p align="left">These new and more diverse relationships offer the potential for individuals to develop, communicate, work, share, travel, explore on a scale not possible in 1996 and to re-balance their lifestyle to reflect a focus on spirituality, environment, land and personal productions.  Existing structures and authority systems which do not respond to individual creativity, and cultural diversity, and the relationships they require will be in conflict with the dynamic of the borderless world and will have to adopt, change or disappear.</p><p align="left">We believe that Australia has the potential to contribute to the realisation of new social and personal relationships for 2121 and convey its process lessons to the wilder world.</p><h4>Skills</h4> <p align="left">We believe that there are three core clusters of skills which are essential if the transition from 1996 to 2121 is going to be achieved.</p><p align="left">1.
